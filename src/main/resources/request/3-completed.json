  "result": "\\rIt\"s a general-purpose, high-level and interpreted scripting langugage. It has no large text files to split up or fixed compiler options to worry about - just code and run it.\\n\\tPython can be learned by reading the documentation and using Python interactively (try out short programs in the interpreter console) as you learn about its language. The manual isn't comprehensive, but is a good starting point; the various books available are also good sources of info. If you get stuck, there is usually someone willing to help on the relevant newsgroup or mailing list.\\n\\rThe Python language has an excellent reputation for being simple, easy to use and understand, with a syntax that loosely maps onto human language - \"it reads like English\". We have no doubt it will make writing many different applications much easier than other languages. It is also easy to integrate into your existing code or environment.\\n\\rThe Python standard library provides many facilities often needed in application programming, and can be extended with the use of additional libraries (many come from existing projects). The following are some notable features:\\n  \\tLocalization Library. Every programmer has written a local time calculation routine at least once. Remarkably enough very few people know what date and time routines such as mktime() actually do, or how to use them correctly.\\n\\rIf you want your application to be available in more than one locale (country), the Python standard library contains modules for various levels of localization: codepage translation on MS-Windows systems, country or region specific info and timezone support via tzset() routines. In many cases it is better not to try to rewrite what can already be done with varying degrees of efficiency.\\n\\rThe Python module _locale has the functionality for character set conversion common in most internationalized applications - a very useful tool when writing programs that should run on various systems and whose text files may be edited on one machine but viewed or manipulated by users from many other machines. The locale library is part of standard Python distribution, it's normally available with any implementation.\\n\\rThe internal Unicode support makes things even simpler: the programmer can simply leave all character set conversions to the system, and work with textual data in your native encoding (either ASCII or Latin-1 on western systems). If your OS doesn't provide a non-ASCII encoding yet - no problem. The internationalization helpers will normally be available as ports of Python for various platforms.\\n\\rStandard library facilities typically build upon the features that we find worth emulating in other languages: strings, lists and files are all very common data structures. Text is handled with UTF-8 (Unicode) decoding and encoding - guaranteed lossless text handling; file I/O uses standard POSIX semantics and binary modes for large files.\\n\\rThe memory allocation interface provides facilities to allocate all sorts of objects in special ways, sometimes allocating larger chunks than the usual system call would do. The garbage collector frees up allocated storage when it's no longer needed - automatic zeroing is supported as well (it can be turned off if speed or space efficiency are important).\\n  \\tSockets provide a standards-based interface for network communication, which abstracts away the implementation differences so that you don't have to know all about them.\\n  \\tA basic debugger is included in this release; it uses Python data types and syntax everywhere possible. It can be used as an example of \"what your program does\" when you step through a hard-to-debug piece of code, or to locate the problem in larger programs. In addition, scripts like pdb.py provide more powerful capabilities.\\n\\rEven for experienced users it may take some time to get accustomed to Python's syntax and ways of doing things - but once you have mastered this modest investment your work as a programmer will probably be easier from then on!\\n\");\n\n  }",
